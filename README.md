# Stegocrypt-GUI
Tool for easily steganographically embedding AES256-CBC encrypted messages into images for ultra-secure communication. Designed for users with no programming experience to get the most out of steganographic communication.

Note: The code here is out of date. I've fixed its main issue and will be uploading a working version shortly. My solution: use Go for the encrypting and decrypting. You'll have a plaintext file created on your computer, but this shouldn't be an issue unless you've been hacked. The point of Stegocrypt-GUI is to enable you to covertly send encrypted messages using images.

Note 2: Memes are inconspicuous, so they're the perfect vessel for secret messages (just saying, lol).

Note 3: You'll need to ensure that the image is not compressed when sending it to your recipient. Email attachments are usually good for this.
