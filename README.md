- Made the terminal output more intelligible / useful

- Deleted useless code from script.
- Deleted unnecessary code that limited the randomness of password generation.


-------------------------

Note: Memes are inconspicuous, so they're the perfect vessel for secret messages (just saying, lol).

Note 2: You'll need to ensure that the image is not compressed when sending it to your recipient. Email attachments are usually good for this.

Note 3: Example picture's password is "Securepassword1!", without the quotation marks
