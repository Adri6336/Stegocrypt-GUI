# Stegocrypt-GUI
Tool for easily steganographically embedding AES256-CBC encrypted messages into images for ultra-secure communication. Designed for users with no programming experience to get the most out of steganographic communication.

Note: This is the first version and it's is still a little unstable. Currently, small messages work perfectly, but the larger it gets the more likely it will fail. This is not a consequence of corruption: I've looked at the before and after and they match well. I'll be working on figuring out the cause of this bug and patching it. For the time being, I'm not going to compile to an exe and you should only use it for small messages if you really want to use it at this state. Cheers! 

Note 2: Memes are inconspicuous, so they're the perfect vessel for secret messages (just saying, lol).
